# Command Model Samples Directory

## ⚠️ Important Notice

This directory contains **sample code and references** for AI coding agents working with the **Command Model** (equivalent to Aggregates in DDD). These files are:

- **NOT part of the production codebase**
- **NOT executed by the application**
- **Reference materials only**

## Purpose

The `/command/` directory serves as a centralized location for:

1. **Command/Aggregate pattern examples** demonstrating event-centric domain modeling
2. **Coding standards and best practices** specific to command processing
3. **Reference architectures** for AI agents implementing business commands
